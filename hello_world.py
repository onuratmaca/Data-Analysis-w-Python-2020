# Everything after a hash sign (#) is considered a comment in Python

# The print statement could be written on the top-level (zero indentation),
# but here we have put it inside the main function.
# This enables TestMyCode (TMC) framework to work correctly.

# In more complicated programs it is good practise not to clutter the top-level of the program
# by using a main function as here.

""" Exercise 1 (hello world)
Fill in the missing piece in the solution stub file hello_world.py in folder src to make it print the following:

Hello, world!

Make sure you use correct indenting. You can run it with command python3 src/hello_world.py.
If the output looks good, then you can test it with command tmc test.
If the tests pass, submit your solution to the server with command tmc submit.

def main():
    # Enter your code here, this is the correct indentation

# This makes sure the main function is not called immediatedly
# when TMC imports this module
